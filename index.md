## Project description

Highlight it (hilit.it) is an open source project.
The goal of the Hilit.it: is an easy way to summarize and share summaries of articles.
as readers find interesting lines in articles, they select/highlight those lines.
when other readers open those articles, they will have the option to see the lines other readers find interesting highlighted.
as more readers highlight lines, an aggregation/consessus can be generated of the most important lines.
