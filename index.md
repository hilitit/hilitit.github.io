# Hilit.it

## Project description

Highlight it (hilit.it) is an open source project.

  * The goal of the Hilit.it is: an easy way to summarize and share summaries of articles.
  * as readers find interesting lines in articles, they select/highlight those lines.
  * when other readers open those articles, they will have the option to see the lines other readers find interesting highlighted.
  * as more readers highlight lines, an aggregation/consessus can be generated of the most important lines.

## Privacy

In order to protect users from accidentaly highlighting sensitive data

 * only HTTP sites are hilitable, HTTPS sites are not hilitable.
 * a list of un hilitable sites will be set, sites like gmail.com,
 * pages are by default un hilitable, until one first user explicitly enables hilit.it for this page
